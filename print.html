<p>You are just starting to program, haven't been coding for too long, or you already have experience working in a team. You might have even participated in Game Jams, or have published projects on a platform that are being monetized.</p>
<p>You have only worked in Unity and/or Unreal, have experience with other engines or have programmed in several languages.</p>
<p>You have only programmed video games, or just come from the world of web and app development. You might have worked both as frontend and backend, from design and layout to server-side communication, APIs and databases.</p>
<p>No, I'm not making assumptions. I know you're in one of these groups, and everyone has something in common: You don't know how to program video games.</p>
<p>And yes, I know you deny it, but don't worry. It's part of the first stage of acceptance.</p>
<h1 id="denial"><a class="header" href="#denial">Denial</a></h1>
<p>You don't know how to program because every time you want to make the movement of a character, melee or ranged attacks, real-time or turn-based, a boss battle, cameras that follow more than one target, the options menu, an inventory system, transitions between scenes, loading bars, a particular genre of video games, or even the clone of a game...</p>
<p>Every time you want to program something, the first thing you do is look for your trusted youtuber who has already uploaded a video programming just what you need, copy the code without knowing why he does it, paste it in your game and ready; you do not understand what you just put but it actually works, which is the point.</p>
<p>With a bit of luck you will try to understand why he has programmed it that way. In the worst cases you will understand how it works and try to apply it in the future, taking that code as the absolute truth. In best cases you will wonder why he doesn't explain it, you will question his criteria as a programmer and you will try to redo it, correcting the errors you have identified.</p>
<p>And yes, right now you are very angry because so far you have only come across videos that do not teach you how to program. But don't worry, it's part of the second stage of acceptance.</p>
<h1 id="anger"><a class="header" href="#anger">Anger</a></h1>
<p>The reality is that no video is going to teach you how to program video games.</p>
<p>Go back to your trusted youtuber, take a look at the videos that have saved your life more than once, and you'll see that the vast majority of them have titles similar to &quot;How to make...&quot;, but never &quot;How to program...&quot;.</p>
<p>It seems like a pretty obvious fact, but the reality is that you're going to watch those videos to be taught something quick that works, but just because it works doesn't mean it's well programmed.</p>
<p>Now that you know that YouTube is not the best place to learn programming, you may be thinking about buying an Udemy course, sign up for a programming bootcamp or do some training that has teachers and offer you a certification for an arm and a leg without an official academic validity.</p>
<p>That’s your case, I'll admit it for you.</p>
<p>And don't worry, it's part of the third stage of acceptance.</p>
<h1 id="negotiation"><a class="header" href="#negotiation">Negotiation</a></h1>
<p>Udemy is not bad, in fact I have purchased quite a few courses that have helped me improve professionally. But don't misunderstand me, they have helped me to identify code snippets that I would never put in my projects, to avoid them and look for other solutions that are efficient and affordable to the project I'm working on. There are very few that have given me that 1% that I didn't expect to find and still apply today, and only one that has really given me a lot of value for the price they usually cost on sales.</p>
<p>I have been in bootcamps and training centers and I'm not going to lie, they are useful if you accept that you’re not going to learn anything, and focus on networking instead. The only ones that I've been to I've managed to end up working for them, but it's a time you've invested just to want to work there, and the reality is that you still don't know how to program video games.</p>
<p>You also have the option of meeting people who you think know how to program better than you, and you can learn from them, listen to their advice and receive feedback to improve. Although the reality is that the level difference might be so high, that you will realize there are so many things to learn that you will not know where to start, and end up collapsing yourself as time goes by.</p>
<p>I guess you are already aware, but you are in the fourth stage of acceptance.</p>
<h1 id="depression"><a class="header" href="#depression">Depression</a></h1>
<p>You are here because you don't know what to do, frustrated with not knowing how to continue, or, in the worst case, you’ve already given up programming video games.</p>
<p>You have stopped enjoying something you were passionate about, and you have come to the conclusion that this is not what you want to do.</p>
<p>You have spent a lot of money and time on something that has not led anywhere, for someone to tell you that it has been useless.</p>
<p>At this point, you need to understand that everything you have done to get here is not a bad thing. We all have our own way to progress, some with greater facilities and opportunities to learn, and others with many impediments and ignorance that make us fall into decisions that may delay our goals.</p>
<p>Avoid excusing yourself wanting to try other things or thinking that you might not be made for this. You know you want to make video games, and any path that takes you away from that is going to make you regret in the future all the time you let pass.</p>
<p>It's not your fault that you haven't learned to program yet. In reality, nobody has the absolute truth and everything you might find is both valid and wrong. In the end it is up to you as a programmer to validate the criteria of another programmer, and that ability is earned through experience of working with many people, whether they know more than you, or are just starting. Understand why they have done it that way, explore new solutions, and know which ones are the best that suits the project you are working on.</p>
<p>You won't find anything that teaches you how to program video games. An artist doesn't watch videos on how to make characters when he has to, a game musician doesn’t look for tutorials on how to make 8-bit music, and a game designer doesn’t look for the exact information about the game he’s working on.</p>
<p>An artist has the knowledge and skills to draw whatever he is asked to or has specialized in. A musician knows how to read music sheets, play instruments and compose whatever he is asked to compose, no matter what style is. A game designer may even use colored cardboards after years of experimentation, having the minimum elements required to have his job done.</p>
<p>A game programmer has to know how to program, not just video games. A programmer who has not seen beyond a video game engine is not really a programmer, he just knows how to write code and make it work, but is not capable of doing anything else if he is taken out of it.</p>
<p>Putting it this way makes a lot of sense, but the most sad of it is that, unlike the rest of the roles in this industry, programmers are the most affected and any decision you make is inevitably likely to lead you to inefficient ways of learning programming.</p>
<p>Knowing all of this, there's no point in regretting anymore. However, you have achieved something that many programmers have not until now, you have accepted that you don’t know how to program.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance"><a class="header" href="#acceptance">Acceptance</a></h1>
<p>Congratulations! Not everyone is able to move forward knowing that they will have to leave behind everything they know about programming and start from scratch. This process can take you many years and there will be times when progress will seem to slow down, but at the same time you have learned a lot even if you don't have any project to prove it.</p>
<p>That is a good sign, it means that this time you are progressing properly, and you will be working in that company or video game that you have been waiting for so long when you least expected.</p>
<p>Luckily, you will not be alone in this new adventure, since I will be guiding you so that this time you can learn how to program videogames and recover that illusion you had since the first day you decided to dedicate yourself to it.</p>
<p>This journey is long, but definitely worth the effort. If you embrace this difficulty and appreciate it as part of the learning process, half of the way will be done.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck, don't give up, and take all the time of your life. It is the only way to reach your goals, no matter how far away they may seem.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>As you may have noticed, this is unlike any programming book you have seen or read so far.</p>
<p>In the following sections you will find a series of information that you may not have seen in your life, or it may sound slightly familiar to you but you don't know it at all.</p>
<p>It is possible that you have found yourself in this situation on more than one occasion when you have tried to learn to program, and you have ended up quitting because you didn’t know how to continue with the information you found.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little secret about learning anything by yourself, and you will have to apply if you want to continue with this guide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🛈 Nothing not put into practice doesn’t have any potential usefulness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I’m aware that you don’t know how to apply it, and that is because all the tutorials and books that you may find are designed for you to learn with the information they give you, followed by ready-made examples that you can copy and paste to see that they, indeed, work.</p>
<p>That is why I have designed this guide, to help you benefit from what I just told you. I'm going to assume that you follow it sequentially, otherwise you won't learn anything and you will find yourself jumping between pages.</p>
<p>I'm not going to explain anything to you either, since there's no point in taking my reasoning to understand it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you might have skipped the rule of following this guide sequentially. Please, go back to the <a href="en/instructions/./preface.html">Preface</a> and read it if you haven’t already. I know you don't want to, but it is necessary in order to continue with this not so necessary but senseless introduction.</p>
<p>You will find examples, but please don't copy them. Any information you might find is an extension of what you have researched on your own, or that I considered to add to help you improve your learning skills.</p>
<p>I can't guarantee you that everything you will learn along the way will be applied in your future jobs, but it will help you get by when facing new challenges and looking for solutions.</p>

<p>There is a ritual that all programmers have to perform when we start our adventure in a new programming language. And no, it has nothing to do with being part of a cult of programmers who worship the almighty creator of a language that has given them the blessing of being able to live financially thanks to its miraculous creation.</p>
<p>Hello World is a program that is used to ensure that a language is properly set up on your system displaying the phrase <code>Hello World!</code>.</p>
<p>Although at first seems a very obvious program without much utility, it hides many mysteries and anecdotes about its origin.</p>
<p>It is such a widely used program that there are pages like <a href="http://helloworldcollection.de/">The Hello World Collection</a> that compile all existing Hello World programs for each programming language and its variants.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't do us any good to know how to print characters across the screen, at least not at the starting point we're at.</p>
<p>You might hate me right now for telling you that there’s no purpose in learning the most used programming software to start programming. If that's so, please go back and refer to the <a href="en/tutorial/../instructions/preface.html">Preface</a>. It’s necessary to accept that you don't know how to program.</p>
<p>Let me explain it with an example for you to understand:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Example of Python 3 Hello World program
print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, you don't need to know how Python works to understand what that piece of code does. And it's true, you don't need to know how it works, but what's the point of starting to program without knowing what kind of black magic hides?</p>
<p>The perfect excuse is that we are just starting to program, and everyone will tell you not to worry about it, you’ll hear it from almost everyone. In my humble opinion, there are two reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first one is that they did care to know how it works underneath, but they have to follow an established syllabus that the teaching group imposes on the students so it doesn't become a complete nightmare for them.</p>
</li>

<p>The second and more common reason is that they, in fact, don’t actually know how it really works, so it’s just pure speculation until they get code properly running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, not caring about how it works can be a huge inconvenience that you've had to deal with on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>Start caring, it will help you survive this guide and anything else you want to learn on your own.</p>

<p>When starting in programming, the language is offering you a set of tools to make your life easier. If you need to display text on the screen, just type and forget. However, you might not know what the computer is doing underneath the code.</p>
<p>Focusing on &quot;what it does” rather than “how is doing it” is called “abstraction”.</p>
<p>As you have seen, you can learn to program and work at it with a programming language, but you will encounter many, <strong>MANY PROBLEMS</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's play a game</p>
<p>I present you a series of exercises written in C#. They are already solved, I don't want you to write anything or get into programming yet.</p>
<p>Before each code fragment you’ll find a question, and your goal is to answer yourself what is happening just by reading it.</p>
<p>Once you are sure about your answer, I recommend you do some research and find out if you were right.</p>
<p>If you don't find the answer or you still have doubts, you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/EdtpmDzsDS">The Nightmare Community</a> discord to read the opinion of more programmers who have gone through this guide, and even mine.</p>

<p>Did you find it difficult?</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, these are very simple exercises, so basic in fact that you may not have thought about them until now.</p>
<p>We give so much importance to the best coding practices that we don't pay attention to those little details that allow us to understand the functionality of a language, and use it to our advantage.</p>
<p>Our time is valuable, and we cannot afford wasting it with a programming language that we don’t know how to use. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself wasting a whole afternoon to find the solution to a problem you don't understand, and you’ll probably blame that game engine we hate but at the same time we love so much, because if they take us out of there and think outside the box, we don't know how to program...</p>
<p>Abstraction is not everything, look beyond and you’ll find the answer to many problems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="where-we-come-from"><a class="header" href="#where-we-come-from">Where we come from</a></h1>
<p>Something that will never cease to amaze me is that programmers program without knowing why. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about their motivation, or what they do for a living. I'm talking about where it comes from and everything that has had to happen so that we can write a series of characters on a notepad with a particular format, and magically do what we need.</p>
<p>If you talk to an artist, he will tell you that the origin of art goes back to the Paleolithic cave paintings. A musician will also agree that in prehistoric times there were manifestations of primitive musical instruments, but it wasn't until Ancient Egypt that first musical scales were used.</p>
<p>Now talk to a programmer, you will be surprised at the non-existent amount of answers you will find from them. The most affected in this case are those programmers who only work in high-level languages, that only do web, mobile, desktop and video game applications.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>But is it necessary to know the origin of computers, programming and computing to be able to work as a programmer?</strong></p>
<p><em>An artist does not need to know that cave paintings were the first vestige of art in humanity, just as a musician does not need to know that the first human beings managed to generate the first musical rhythms by hitting two stones together.</em></p>
<p><strong>So do we need to know it to program?</strong></p>
<p><em>A good artist is able to draw both in digital and traditionally when is asked to. What makes him an artist are his skills, regardless the tools</em></p>
<p><strong>Are you going to answer the question?</strong></p>
<p><em>If I did, I would be breaking one of the main rules of this guide.</em></p>
<br/>
<p>Considering where we are coming from can be quite interesting. Academics aside, the truth is that the history of computeting is so short that can be learnt in one morning.</p>
<p>You can start searching at your own pace. However, since we are still in the tutorial, I will give you a little chronology to let you know if you are on the right track or if you are doing too much research:</p>

<li>(1947) Transistor</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have done enough research, you will realize that there are certain pieces of information that may seem unnecessary and some of the essentials to understand how a computer works are missing. As I said, the purpose of this guide is to help you learn how to learn, any advice or help you receive is just another programmer's opinion.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I have decided to stop the chronology at the transistor. The truth is that there are a number of relevant dates related to the emergence of electricity, television, integrated circuits, the first generation of consoles, CP/M and DOS. They are important and we will see them in detail when necessary, but with the appearance of the transistor we have enough to understand how the computer you use for programming works.</p>
<p>Don't rush to the next section, take your time until you've learned everything you need to learn.</p>
<p>At the same time, you must know when to stop.</p>
<p>Don't rush, take your time and go back whenever you need it. I encourage you to repeat until the information is well digested.</p>
<p>Feed back everything you have learned so you can contrast what you knew before with what you know now.</p>

<p>If you've already read the <a href="en/fundamentals/../tutorial/cronology.html">Cronology</a> you will realize how different is the programming of the first computers from today's standards.</p>
<p>If I had to explain to you how everything works from scratch, I would be venturing through many concepts of electricity and digital electronics that you already studied in high school and you probably don't even remember.</p>
<p>Long story short, we won't go over how a computer works at the electronic level. Although an interesting topic, it's a field completely away from programming that, at the moment, we are not interested in.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would recommend you to get up to date with the following concepts. They're not strictly necessary to continue, but they will be quite useful to understand the following pages:</p>

<p>Leaving aside any forum-addicts dispute about which is the best operating system, let me tell you a worth reading story about programmers with which you may feel related to:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<h1 id="pepe-the-programmer"><a class="header" href="#pepe-the-programmer">Pepe the Programmer</a></h1>
</center>
<p>Once upon a time was a young programmer called Pepe. He lived in a student apartment paid with his parent's savings in Madrid.</p>
<p>While his flatmates were partying on the weekends, Pepe always stayed in his room programming with Unity to keep learning. They also made a lot of memes of him in the meantime.</p>
<p>One day, Pepe received an email. He was accepted to work on a Candy Crush-type mobile game with a league and weekly tournaments system. Despite having experience in mobile video game programming on his own, he never published any on Google Play or the App Store before.</p>
<p>The next day, he arrived at the office to start working. After meeting the team, he received his first task: solving a bug that caused the player's score not to register in the server after completing a level.</p>
<p>Pepe had no idea where to start. He didn't even know what a server was. The lead programmer told him that a server is nothing but a simple computer, only that it's always on.</p>
<p>To start working from it, Pepe asked where the computer was. Suddenly, an awkward silence happened among the group. The lead programmer asked him why he needed to know that; he could connect via SSH in the first place.</p>
<p>As expected, Pepe had no idea, but he got it. After a few hours, the lead programmer passed by his desk to see how they were doing. He saw that PuTTY had been installed but didn't know how to use it.</p>
<p>The lead programmer sat down and told him to open the command prompt to connect to the server IP on the local network using the ssh command.</p>
<p>Pepe was mesmerized, as it was the first time he saw something like that. But that dazzling interest quickly faded into despair when he realized that it had no graphical interface, so he had to learn how to move between directories to access the database and create a column for the score deleted by mistake.</p>
<p>Definitely, Pepe had much happier times programming in Unity.</p>
<p>Even so, Pepe realized that a programmer needed some general knowledge that didn't learn only through videogame programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it may seem a hypothetical case, you will most likely encounter some similar situation throughout your career:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pepe has created an <code>/user/rewards</code> path on the server responsible for giving bounties to the 30 highest score players in the tournament, but he has to upload the changes to the repository, but he has never used the git command through a terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pepe encountered a bug that he can't identify because it only happens when he makes the game build and tests it on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>He could do debugging with <code>adb logcat -s Unity</code>, but because he doesn't know how to use a terminal he wastes the whole day doing builds to find a solution by trial and error without knowing what he's doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I have laid you out several cases where you will need a terminal, you might want to give it a try to avoid future inconveniences.</p>
<p>If you still consider it unnecessary, don't worry. You'll find plenty of examples on future pages to know where to start.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="prefacio"><a class="header" href="#prefacio">Prefacio</a></h1>
<p>Tal vez estás empezando a programar, no llevas mucho tiempo, o ya tienes experiencia previa trabajando en equipo. Puede que incluso hayas participado en Game Jams, o tengas proyectos publicados que están siendo monetizados en alguna plataforma.</p>
<p>Has trabajado únicamente en Unity y/o Unreal, tienes experiencia con otros motores o ya has programado en varios lenguajes.</p>
<p>Sólo has programado videojuegos, o vienes del mundo del desarrollo web y apps. Has trabajado tanto de frontend como backend, desde diseño y maquetación hasta la comunicación con el servidor, APIs y bases de datos.</p>
<p>No estoy haciendo suposiciones, estás en uno de estos grupos y todos tienen algo en común: No saben programar videojuegos.</p>
<p>Sí, sé que lo estás negando. No te preocupes, forma parte de la primera etapa de aceptación.</p>
<h1 id="negación"><a class="header" href="#negación">Negación</a></h1>
<p>Ya sea hacer el movimiento de un personaje, ataques a melee o a distancia, en tiempo real o por turnos, la batalla de un boss, cámaras que siguen a más de un objetivo, el menú de opciones, un sistema de inventario, transiciones entre escenas, barras de carga, un género de videojuegos en concreto, o incluso el clon de un juego...</p>
<p>Cada vez que quieres programar algo, simplemente buscas a tu youtuber de confianza, que ya ha subido un video programando justo lo que necesitas, copias el código sin saber por qué lo hace, lo pegas en tu juego y listo; no entiendes lo que has puesto pero funciona, que es lo importante.</p>
<p>Con algo de suerte intentarás entender por qué lo ha programado así. En el peor de los casos entenderás su funcionamiento para tratar de replicarlo en un futuro, tomando ese código como la verdad absoluta. En el mejor de los casos, te preguntarás por qué no lo explica, pondrás en duda su criterio como programador e intentarás rehacerlo, corrigiendo los errores que has identificado.</p>
<p>Y sí, ahora mismo estás muy enfadado, porque no has encontrado videos que te enseñen realmente a programar. No te preocupes, forma parte de la segunda etapa de aceptación.</p>
<h1 id="ira"><a class="header" href="#ira">Ira</a></h1>
<p>La realidad es que ningún video te va a enseñar a programar videojuegos.</p>
<p>De hecho, verás que la gran mayoría de videos de tu canal de programación favorito tienen títulos similares a &quot;Como hacer...&quot; pero nunca, &quot;Como programar...&quot;.</p>
<p>Parece un hecho bastante obvio, pero la realidad es que ves esos videos para que te enseñen algo rápido y que funcione, pero que funcione no significa que esté bien programado.</p>
<p>Ahora que sabes que YouTube no es el lugar más adecuado para aprender a programar, estarás pensando en comprar un curso en Udemy, apuntarte a un bootcamp de programación o empezar alguna formación académica con profesores que ofrezcan un certificado &quot;oficial&quot; a cambio de un riñón sin ninguna validez real.</p>
<p>Es tu caso, ya lo admito yo por ti.</p>
<p>Y no te preocupes, forma parte de la tercera etapa de aceptación.</p>
<h1 id="negociación"><a class="header" href="#negociación">Negociación</a></h1>
<p>Udemy no está mal, de hecho yo he comprado bastantes cursos que me han ayudado a mejorar profesionalmente. Pero no me malinterpretes, a mí me han ayudado a identificar fragmentos de código que nunca pondría en mis proyectos, para evitarlos y buscar otras soluciones que sean eficientes y asequibles al proyecto en el que esté trabajando. Hay muy pocos que me han aportado ese 1% que no me esperaba encontrar y sigo aplicando a día de hoy, y sólo uno que realmente me ha aportado mucho mas valor del que inicialmente pagué.</p>
<p>He estado en bootcamps y centros de formación, y no te voy a mentir: son útiles si aceptas que no vas aprender nada, y en su lugar te centras en hacer networking. En los únicos en los que he estado conseguí trabajar para ellos. No obstante, seguimos sin saber programar videojuegos.</p>
<p>También tienes la opción de conocer personas que consideres que saben programar mejor que tú y, por tanto, puedas aprender de ellos, escuchar sus consejos y recibir feedback para mejorar. Aunque la realidad es que la diferencia de nivel será tan alta que acabarás dejándolo debido a la gran cantidad de cosas que aún te quedan por aprender.</p>
<p>Supongo que ya eres consciente de ello, pero estás en la cuarta etapa de aceptación.</p>
<h1 id="depresión"><a class="header" href="#depresión">Depresión</a></h1>
<p>Estás aquí porque estás frustrado, ya no sabes qué hacer ni cómo continuar. En el peor de los casos ya has renunciado a programar videojuegos.</p>
<p>Has dejado de disfrutar de algo que te apasionaba, y tal vez llegaste a la conclusión de que no estás hecho para esto.</p>
<p>Te has dejado una gran cantidad de dinero y de tiempo en algo que no te ha llevado a ningún lado, solo para que alguien te diga que no ha servido de nada.</p>
<p>Llegados a este punto, tienes que comprender que todo lo que has hecho para llegar hasta aquí es malo. Todos tenemos nuestra forma única de progresar, algunos con mayores facilidades y oportunidades para aprender, y otros con muchos impedimentos y desconocimientos que nos hacen tomar aquellas decisiones que nos retrasan en aquello que queremos conseguir.</p>
<p>No te impongas excusas de querer probar otras cosas porque no se te da bien. Sabes que quieres hacer videojuegos, y cualquier otro camino que te aleje de ello va a conseguir que te arrepientas en un futuro de todo lo que dejaste pasar.</p>
<p>No es culpa tuya no haber aprendido todavía a programar. En realidad, nadie tiene la verdad absoluta, y todo lo que puedas encontrar es tanto válido como erróneo. Al final, depende de tí como programador tener la capacidad de validar el criterio de otro programador, y esa capacidad se obtiene trabajando con muchas personas, tanto si saben más que tú como si están empezando. Entender por qué lo han hecho así, explorar nuevas soluciones, y saber escoger la que más se adapte al proyecto en el que estés trabajando forma parte del proceso de aprendizaje.</p>
<p>No vas a encontrar nada que te enseñe a programar videojuegos. Un artista no necesita ver videos sobre cómo hacer personajes. Un músico no busca tutoriales sobre cómo hacer música de 8 bits. Un game designer no busca información literal acerca del juego de plataformas que tiene que diseñar.</p>
<p>Un artista posee los conceptos y habilidades necesarias para dibujar aquello que le pidan o en lo que se ha especializado en hacer; un músico sabe leer partituras, tocar instrumentos y componer lo que le pidan sin importar el estilo que sea. Un game designer es capaz de hacer un juego con cartulinas de colores, porque ha dedicado su vida a explorar todas las ideas posibles para plasmarlas con los elementos mínimos indispensables para que sea jugable. En definitiva, son capaces de hacer su trabajo adaptándose a las circunstancias.</p>
<p>Un programador de videojuegos tiene que saber programar, no sólo videojuegos. Un programador que no ha visto más allá de un motor de videojuegos no es un programador, es una persona que sabe escribir código y hacer que funcione, pero no es capaz de hacer nada más si lo sacan de su entorno.</p>
<p>Dicho así tiene mucho sentido, pero la triste realidad es que, a diferencia del resto de roles en la industria, los programadores son los más afectados. Cualquier decisión que tomes puede llevarte a cientos de formas ineficientes de aprender a programar.</p>
<p>Ahora ya sabes que esto es así, y que no tiene sentido seguir lamentándose por ello. Aunque no lo parezca, has conseguido algo que muchos programadores no han logrado hasta ahora, has conseguido aceptar que no sabes programar.</p>
<h1 id="aceptación"><a class="header" href="#aceptación">Aceptación</a></h1>
<p>¡Felicidades! No todo el mundo es capaz de seguir adelante sabiendo que va a tener que dejar atrás todo lo que sabe de programación para empezar de cero. Este proceso te puede llevar muchos años, y habrá ocasiones en las que pienses que no has conseguido nada; pero al mismo tiempo has aprendido muchísimo, aunque no tengas ningún proyecto con el que poder demostrarlo. </p>
<p>Eso es una buena señal, significa que esta vez estás progresando adecuadamente, y cuando menos te lo esperes estarás trabajando en esa empresa o videojuego que tanto tiempo llevas esperando.</p>
<p>Por suerte, no vas a estar sólo en esta aventura, ya que te estaré guiando para que puedas, por fin, aprender a programar videojuegos, y vuelvas a recuperar esa ilusión que tenías desde el primer día que decidiste dedicarte a esto.</p>
<p>Te advierto que no será un camino de rosas, pero el esfuerzo merecerá la pena. Si disfrutas del desafío, todo será mucho más llevadero.</p>
<p>Te deseo mucha suerte, no desistas, y tómate todo el tiempo de tu vida. Es la única forma de poder alcanzar tus objetivos por muy lejos que parezcan estar.</p>

<p>Como has podido observar, esta guía no se parece a ningún libro de programación que hayas podido leer hasta ahora.</p>
<p>En las siguientes secciones encontrarás una serie de información que no habrás visto en tu vida, o te suene ligeramente pero no conozcas del todo.</p>
<p>Es posible que te hayas encontrado en una situación similar a esta en más de una ocasión; has intentado aprender a programar, y acabaste renunciando debido a que no sabías cómo continuar con la información que encontraste.</p>
<p>Permíteme revelarte una norma no escrita en el mundo del aprendizaje autodidacta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🛈 Nada de lo que te diga va a servir si no lo pones en práctica por tus propios medios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>La mayoría de libros y tutoriales acerca de programación están diseñados para ofrecerte información específica seguida de ejemplos que tú mismo puedes copiar y pegar para comprobar que funcionan. Esta forma de aprender resulta limitada si queremos comprender qué estamos haciendo exactamente y, por tanto, desarrollar una visión holística del proceso.</p>
<p>Es por ello que he diseñado esta guía; para ayudarte a aprender por tu cuenta. Voy a dar por hecho que la estás leyendo de forma secuencial y ordenada, de lo contrario irás saltando de página en página y habrá momentos en los que no entenderás lo que estás leyendo.</p>
<p>Tampoco voy a explicarte nada, ya que no tiene sentido usar mi razonamiento para entenderlo. Si no sabes de lo que estoy hablando, tal vez sea porque ya te saltaste la norma de seguir la guía de forma secuencial. Vuelve al <a href="es/instrucciones/./prefacio.html">Prefacio</a>. Sé que no quieres leerlo, pero cuanto antes lo hagas, antes podremos dejar esta introducción tan absurda.</p>
<p>Encontrarás ejemplos, sí, pero te ruego que no los copies. Toda información que puedas encontrar es una ampliación de lo que ya has investigado por tu cuenta, o consejos que he añadido para mejorar tu habilidad de aprender por tu cuenta.</p>
<p>No puedo garantizarte que todo lo que aprendas vayas a aplicarlo cuando trabajes, pero te ayudará a ser autosuficiente a la hora de buscar soluciones y enfrentarte a nuevos retos.</p>

<p>Existe un ritual que todos los programadores tenemos que realizar cuando iniciamos nuestra aventura en un nuevo lenguaje de programación. Y no, no tiene nada que ver con formar parte de una secta de programadores que adoran al todopoderoso creador de un lenguaje que les ha dado la bendición de poder vivir económicamente gracias a su milagrosa creación.</p>
<p>El Hola Mundo es un programa que se utiliza para asegurarse de que un lenguaje está bien configurado en tu sistema, mostrando por pantalla la frase <code>¡Hola, Mundo!</code>.</p>
<p>Aunque a simple vista parezca un programa muy obvio y sin mucha utilidad, esconde muchos misterios y anécdotas sobre su origen.</p>
<p>Es un programa tan usado, que existen páginas como <a href="http://helloworldcollection.de/">The Hello World Collection</a> que se encargan de recopilar todos los programas de Hola Mundo existentes para cada lenguaje de programación y sus variantes.</p>
<p>Por desgracia, no nos sirve de nada saber cómo imprimir caracteres por pantalla, al menos no en el punto de partida en el que estamos.</p>
<p>Es posible que ahora mismo me odies por decirte que no nos sirve de nada el programa más usado para empezar a aprender a programar. Si eso es así, vuelve al <a href="es/tutorial/../instrucciones/prefacio.html">Prefacio</a>. Significa que aún no has aceptado que no sabes programar.</p>
<p>Déjame explicártelo con un ejemplo para que lo entiendas:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Ejemplo del programa Hola Mundo en Python 3
print(&quot;¡Hola, Mundo!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Como puedes ver, no necesitas saber cómo funciona Python para entender qué hace ese fragmento de código. Y es cierto, no necesitas saber cómo funciona pero, ¿qué sentido tiene comenzar a programar con algo sin saber qué clase de magia negra esconde?</p>
<p>La excusa perfecta es que estamos empezando a programar, y todo el mundo te dirá que no te preocupes por ello. Todas las personas que me han dicho eso han sido por dos motivos:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>El primero de ellos es que sí se han preocupado por saber cómo funciona por debajo, pero tienen que ajustarse a un temario que el equipo docente impone a los alumnos para que el profesor de turno no les haga el año imposible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>El segundo y más común es que sencillamente todavía no se han llegado a preocupar por cómo funciona, y siguen pegando cañonazos a ciegas hasta que el código funciona sin saber por qué.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>En cualquier caso, no preocuparnos por cómo funciona puede suponer un gran dolor de cabeza con el que habrás tenido que lidiar en más de una ocasión.</p>
<p>Empieza a preocuparte, te ayudará a sobrevivir en esta guía y en todo lo que quieras aprender por tu cuenta.</p>

<p>Cuando empiezas a programar, el lenguaje te ofrece una serie de herramientas para facilitarte la vida. Si necesitas mostrar texto por pantalla, sólo tienes que preocuparte por pasarle el texto que quieres, pero no sabes qué está haciendo el ordenador por debajo para lograr ese objetivo.</p>
<p>A este énfasis en preocuparte únicamente por &quot;¿qué hace?&quot; en lugar de &quot;¿cómo lo hace?&quot; se lo conoce como abstracción.</p>
<p>Cómo ya has podido observar, puedes aprender a programar y trabajar de ello con un lenguaje de programación, pero tendrás muchos, <strong>MUCHOS PROBLEMAS</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vamos a jugar a un juego:</p>
<p>Te presento una serie de ejercicios escritos en C#. Ya están resueltos,  no quiero que escribas nada ni te pongas a programar.</p>
<p>Antes de cada fragmento de código encontrarás una pregunta; tu objetivo es responderte a ti mismo qué está ocurriendo con sólo leerlo.</p>
<p>Una vez que tengas clara tu respuesta, te recomiendo que investigues para descubrir si estabas en lo cierto.</p>
<p>Si no encuentras la respuesta o sigues teniendo dudas, puedes unirte al Discord de <a href="https://discord.gg/EdtpmDzsDS">The Nightmare Community</a> para leer la opinión de más programadores que han pasado por esta guía, además de la mía.</p>

<p>¿Te han parecido difíciles las preguntas?</p>
<p>Como habrás podido notar, son ejercicios muy simples, pero a su vez tan básicos que no te habrás planteado hasta ahora.</p>
<p>Le damos mucha importancia a saber cuáles son las mejores prácticas de código, ignorando por completo esos pequeños detalles que nos permiten comprender la funcionalidad de un lenguaje y usarlo a nuestro favor.</p>
<p>Nuestro tiempo es muy valioso, y no podemos perderlo con un lenguaje de programación que no sabemos utilizar. De lo contrario, perderás una tarde entera para encontrar la solución a un problema que no entiendes, y le echarás la culpa a ese motor de videojuegos que tanto odiamos, pero al mismo tiempo amamos, porque si nos sacan de ahí, no sabemos programar nada...</p>
<p>La abstracción no lo es todo, mira más allá y encontrarás la respuesta a muchos de tus problemas.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="de-dónde-venimos"><a class="header" href="#de-dónde-venimos">De dónde venimos</a></h1>
<p>Algo que nunca dejará de sorprenderme es que los programadores programan sin saber por qué. No estoy hablando sobre su motivación para programar ni a qué quieren dedicarse. Me refiero a cuál es su origen y todo lo que ha tenido que suceder para que podamos escribir una serie de caracteres en un bloc de notas, con un formato en concreto, y mágicamente haga lo que necesitemos.</p>
<p>Si hablas con un artista, te dirá que el origen del Arte se remonta a las pinturas rupestres del Paleolítico. Un músico también estará de acuerdo en que hubo manifestaciones musicales prehistóricas mediante el uso de instrumentos primitivos, aunque no sería hasta el Antiguo Egipto cuando se comenzaría a utilizar la primera escala musical.</p>
<p>En cambio, te sorprendería la inexistente cantidad de respuestas que te encontrarás por parte de un programador acerca de su materia. Los más afectados en este caso son aquellos que sólo trabajan en lenguajes de alto nivel, encargados únicamente de aplicaciones webs, móviles, de escritorio y videojuegos.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>¿Es necesario saber el origen de los ordenadores, la programación y la informática para poder trabajar de programador?</strong></p>
<p><em>Un artista no necesita saber que las pinturas rupestres fueron el primer vestigio de arte en la humanidad, al igual que un músico no necesita saber que los primeros ritmos musicales se generaron chocando dos piedras</em></p>
<p><strong>¿Entonces necesitamos saberlo para programar?</strong></p>
<p><em>La herramienta no hace al artista. Los conceptos usados en un retrato realista son los mismos tanto en pintura tradicional como en digital.</em></p>
<p><strong>¿Vas a responder a mi pregunta?</strong></p>
<p><em>Si lo hiciese, estaría rompiendo una de las principales normas de esta guía.</em></p>
<br/>
<p>De todos modos, conocer nuestro origen no te hará daño, y puede que hasta te resulte interesante. Aunque pueda parecer un tostón académico, típico de asignaturas de un cuatrimestre de universidad, lo cierto es que la historia del ordenador es tan corta que puede ser explicada en una mañana.</p>
<p>No creo necesario mencionar ninguna página, libro o referencia donde puedas comenzar a investigar. No obstante, y como aún estamos en el tutorial, voy a regalarte una pequeña cronología para que sepas si vas por el buen camino o estás investigando de más:</p>
<ul>
<li>(5000 a.c) Ábaco</li>
<li>(1452-1519) Máquina de sumar de Leonardo Da Vinci</li>
<li>(1613) Richard Brathwait</li>

<li>(1945) Arquitectura Von Neumann</li>
<li>(1946) ENIAC</li>
<li>(1946) EDVAC</li>
<li>(1947) Transistor</li>
</ul>
<p>Si has investigado lo suficiente, notarás datos adicionales innecesarios, o que faltan otros esenciales para entender cómo funciona un ordenador. Como ya te he dicho, el propósito de esta guía es ayudarte a aprender, cualquier consejo o ayuda que recibas es meramente la opinión de un programador más.</p>
<p>Te estarás preguntando por qué he decidido parar la cronología a partir del transistor. Lo cierto es que hay una serie de fechas relevantes relacionadas con la aparición de la electricidad, la televisión, los circuitos integrados, la primera generación de consolas, CP/M y DOS. Son importantes y las veremos en detalle cuando sea necesario, aunque con la aparición del transistor tenemos de sobra para entender como funciona el ordenador que usas para programar.</p>
<p>No tengas prisa por ir a la siguiente sección, tómate todo el tiempo que necesites hasta que hayas aprendido todo lo que tengas que aprender.</p>
<p>Insisto, no te lo voy a decir yo, debes saber cuando parar.</p>
<p>Si continúas con la guía y sientes que te falta algo por aprender, no dudes en volver sobre tus pasos.</p>
<p>Repite las lecciones hasta que las hayas asimilado. Después, retroalimenta todo lo que has aprendido, contrastando lo que ya sabías con lo que ahora sabes.</p>

<p>Si has leido la <a href="es/fundamentos/../tutorial/cronologia.html">Cronología</a> habrás visto que la programación de los primeros ordenadores es muy distinta a la que solemos tener actualmente.</p>
<p>Si tuviera que explicarte como funciona todo desde cero, tendría que repasar muchos conceptos de electricidad y electrónica digital que estudiaste cuando estabas en la escuela secundaria, y que posiblemente ni te acuerdes.</p>
<p>En definitiva, no puedo aconsejarte que empieces entendiendo como funciona un ordenador a nivel de circuitos electrónicos, porque es un campo completamente alejado de la programación que de momento no nos interesa ni nos conviene.</p>
<p>No obstante, te recomiendo que te pongas al día con los siguientes conceptos. No son necesarios para continuar con la guía, pero te ayudará bastante a entender las siguientes páginas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Álgebra Booleana</li>
<li>Puertas lógicas</li>
<li>Adición binaria</li>
<li>Bits de acarreo</li>
<li>Medio sumador</li>
<li>Sumador completo</li>
<li>Complemento a dos</li>
<li>Sumador de 8 bits</li>
<li>ALU</li>
<li>Registros</li>
<li>Bytes y Nibbles</li>
<li>Sistema Hexadecimal</li>
<li>Códigos de operación</li>

<p>Dejando a un lado la típica pelea de foroadictos sobre cuál es el mejor sistema operativo, es hora de que leas una pequeña historia con la que te sentirás identificado:</p>

<h1 id="pepe-el-programador"><a class="header" href="#pepe-el-programador">Pepe el Programador</a></h1>
</center>
<p>Érase una vez un de videojuegos llamada Pepe, que vivía en un piso para estudiantes en Madrid, pagado con el ahorro de sus padres.</p>
<p>Mientras sus compañeros de piso se iban de fiesta todos los fines de semanas, Pepe permanecía diligente en su cuarto programando con Unity para seguir aprendiendo. Además, era víctima de múltiples memes, algunos bastante buenos.</p>
<p>Un día, Pepe fue aceptado para trabajar en un videojuego de móviles parecido a Candy Crush, que poseía un sistema de ligas y torneos semanales. Pepe tenía experiencia programando videojuegos de móviles por su cuenta, pero no había publicado ninguno en Google Play ni en la App Store.</p>
<p>Al día siguiente, cuando llegó a la oficina para comenzar a trabajar y, tras conocer a sus compañeros, le presentaron su primera tarea: Solucionar un bug en el que el servidor no guarda la puntuación obtenida de un jugador al completar un nivel.</p>
<p>Pepe no tenía ni idea de por dónde empezar; de hecho, no sabía ni lo que era un servidor. El programador jefe le explicó que un servidor es un ordenador como cualquier otro, con la diferencia de que siempre está encendido.</p>
<p>Tan pronto como Pepe preguntó dónde se encontraba dicho ordenador, el resto de compañeros le miraron sin saber qué decir. El programador jefe le preguntó por qué necesitaba saber dónde estaba el servidor, si podía conectarse por SSH.</p>
<p>Como era de esperar, Pepe no entendió nada, aunque se puso con ello. Pasadas unas horas, el programador jefe se pasó por su mesa para ver cómo lo llevaba. Para su sorpresa, comprobó que había instalado PuTTY, pero no sabía cómo usarlo.</p>
<p>El programador jefe se sentó junto a él y le pidió que abriera la consola de comandos para conectarse a la ip del servidor de la red local con el comando ssh.</p>
<p>Pepe estaba alucinando, ya que era la primera vez que veía algo así; no obstante, esa ilusión pronto se convertiría en desesperación al darse cuenta de que no poseía una interfaz gráfica, por lo que era necesario aprender a moverse entre los directorios para acceder a la base de datos, y crear una columna para la puntuación que se había borrado por error...</p>
<p>Definitivamente, Pepe era mucho más feliz programando en Unity.</p>
<p>A pesar de todo, aprendió una valiosa lección: un programador necesita tener unos conocimientos generales que no se aprenden únicamente programando videojuegos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aunque parezca un caso hipotético, puedes encontrarte con situaciones similares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pepe ha creado una ruta <code>/user/rewards</code> en el servidor que se encarga de dar recompensas a los 30 jugadores con mayor puntuación del torneo, pero tiene que subir los cambios al repositorio y nunca ha usado el comando git a través de un terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pepe ha encontrado un bug que no consigue identificar, ya que sólo ocurre cuando hace la build del juego y lo prueba en su móvil.</p>
<p>Podría hacer debugging con <code>adb logcat -s Unity</code>, pero Pepe no sabe cómo usar un terminal, así que pierde un día entero haciendo builds a base de prueba y error hasta encontrar la solución sin saber cómo lo ha conseguido.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahora que he expuesto varios casos en los que vas a necesitar un terminal, quizás quieras intentarlo por tu cuenta para ahorrarte sorpresas inesperadas.</p>
<p>Si crees que aún no es necesario, no te preocupes. En las próximas páginas tendrás ejemplos más explicativos para que sepas por donde empezar.</p>
