# Do not use Windows

Leaving aside any forum-addicts dispute about which is the best operating system, let me tell you a worth reading story about programmers with which you may feel related to:

> Once upon a time was a young programmer called Pepe. He lived in a student apartment paid with his parent's savings in Madrid.
>
> While his flatmates were partying on the weekends, Pepe always stayed in his room programming with Unity to keep learning. They also made a lot of memes of him in the meantime.
>
> One day, Pepe received an email. He was accepted to work on a Candy Crush-type mobile game with a league and weekly tournaments system. Despite having experience in mobile video game programming on his own, he never published any on Google Play or the App Store before.
>
> The next day, he arrived at the office to start working. After meeting the team, he received his first task: solving a bug that caused the player's score not to register in the server after completing a level.
>
> Pepe had no idea where to start. He didn't even know what a server was. The lead programmer told him that a server is nothing but a simple computer, only that it's always on.
>
> To start working from it, Pepe asked where the computer was. Suddenly, an awkward silence happened among the group. The lead programmer asked him why he needed to know that; he could connect via SSH in the first place.
>
> As expected, Pepe had no idea, but he got it. After a few hours, the lead programmer passed by his desk to see how they were doing. He saw that PuTTY had been installed but didn't know how to use it.
>
> The lead programmer sat down and told him to open the command prompt to connect to the server IP on the local network using the ssh command.
>
> Pepe was mesmerized, as it was the first time he saw something like that. But that dazzling interest quickly faded into despair when he realized that it had no graphical interface, so he had to learn how to move between directories to access the database and create a column for the score deleted by mistake.
>
> Definitely, Pepe had much happier times programming in Unity.
>
> Even so, Pepe realized that a programmer needed some general knowledge that didn't learn only through videogame programming.

Although it may seem a hypothetical case, you will most likely encounter some similar situation throughout your career:

> Pepe has created an `/user/rewards` path on the server responsible for giving bounties to the 30 highest score players in the tournament, but he has to upload the changes to the repository, but he has never used the git command through a terminal.

> Pepe encountered a bug that he can't identify because it only happens when he makes the game build and tests it on his mobile phone.
>
> He could do debugging with `adb logcat -s Unity`, but because he doesn't know how to use a terminal he wastes the whole day doing builds to find a solution by trial and error without knowing what he's doing.

Now that I have laid you out several cases where you will need a terminal, you might want to give it a try to avoid future inconveniences.

If you still consider it unnecessary, don't worry. You'll find plenty of examples on future pages to know where to start.
